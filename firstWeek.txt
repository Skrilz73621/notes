To be honest, i didn't learn a lot from these classes, because, most time during the classes we were doing nothing. But I've been learning a lot of stuff during the hakaton that you gave to us, for example: new commands for git, how to work in a team, new words in English, random.shuffle(), how to import libraries into branches, different between oop, pop. What is inheritance, encapsulations etc. But I still don't know how to manage with backend and database.
